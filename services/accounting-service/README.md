# ðŸ§® Accounting Service

## Overview
The `accounting-service` manages **financial tracking and ledger consistency** for all cash flows in the trading system. It ensures that every wallet update, trade, funding, fee, or liquidation event is properly logged into an internal ledger for audit and compliance.

---

## Responsibilities

- Maintain internal double-entry accounting for:
  - Trades
  - PnL
  - Funding
  - Fees
  - Withdrawals/Deposits
- Track all wallet changes as accounting journal entries
- Validate that system remains financially balanced

---

## Journal Format

Each event is recorded as:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18T12:34:00Z",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "type": "trade_pnl",
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "amount": -50.25,
  "wallet_before": 1020.75,
  "wallet_after": 970.50
}
```
